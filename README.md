## Why CrewAI?
The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer. CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

## Key Features
Role-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.
Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.
Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.
Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.
Save output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.
Parse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.
Works with Open Source Models: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!
